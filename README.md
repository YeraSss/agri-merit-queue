AgriMerit Queue | Kazakhstan Agricultural Subsidy System

Decentrathon 5.0 | Government Case 2b | Stage 1

Replacing first-come-first-served subsidy allocation with a transparent, merit-based queue — backed by LightGBM and explainable scoring.

⸻

The Problem

Kazakhstan’s agricultural subsidy system pays 7,615 approved farmers in the order they submitted their applications. When regional budgets run out, legitimate farms wait indefinitely — not because their applications are weak, but because they clicked “submit” one day too late.

The result: 42.34 billion tenge frozen across 7,615 applications as of March 2026. Almaty oblast: 14.3B frozen, 0 tenge paid. Zhambyl oblast: 6.3B frozen, 0 tenge paid.

Our Solution

A merit-based queue replacement system that re-ranks the frozen backlog by farm development potential, not submission timestamp — while fully preserving the legal requirement that humans approve all payment decisions.

Hybrid scoring formula:

hybrid_merit_score = 0.60 * ml_merit_score + 0.40 * rule_merit_score

ml_merit_score   = (1 - P(rejection)) * 100   <- LightGBM, AUC = 0.8235
rule_merit_score = 0.40 * farm_size_score
                 + 0.30 * region_health_score
                 + 0.30 * livestock_priority_score

Key SHAP finding: The top 2 drivers of rejection risk are region historical rejection rate and day of year — both entirely outside farmer control. 65% of rejection risk is structural inequality, not farm quality.

Model Details
	•	Algorithm: LightGBM classifier (300 estimators, max_depth=6)
	•	Task: Predict P(rejection) → invert to merit signal
	•	AUC (5-fold CV): 0.8235 ± 0.0042
	•	Training set: 34,390 applications (2025–2026)
	•	Features: 15 engineered features (region stats, farm scale, timing, livestock type)

Top SHAP Drivers

| Feature | Mean |SHAP| | Meaning |
|———|———––|———|
| Region rejection rate | 1.016 | Structural regional inequality |
| Day of year | 0.337 | First-come-first-served timing bias |
| Subsidy norm | 0.327 | Subsidy type friction |
| Log implied head count | 0.173 | Farm scale signal |
| Livestock rejection rate | 0.151 | Sector-level patterns |

Legal Compliance

This system never auto-rejects. It ranks and flags only. All payment orders require a human MIO official signature (per Rules paragraphs 21–24). The fairness slider lets committees tune small-farm protection. Every score, flag, and override is logged.
